It was a summer afternoon in 2016 - I picked up Photoshop for the first time to make myself a new wallpaper. Time flies, and in a blink of an eye, here I am in 2022, graduating from School of Art, University of Manitoba as a design practitioner.

Coming from the background of a STEM-based family, I happen to develop a pragmatic approach to research and design, which is personalized by a strong sense of minimalist aesthetic and a touch of femininity.

When I'm not designing you can find me binge reading lifestyle and architecture magazines, playing the piano, or tending to my two succulents.
